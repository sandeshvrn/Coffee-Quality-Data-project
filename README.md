# ‚òï Coffee Quality Analysis with Power BI

## üìå Project Overview

This capstone Power BI project analyzes a real-world coffee quality dataset to uncover insights into the key factors influencing overall cup quality. The goal is to support coffee producers, quality inspectors, and industry stakeholders in making data-driven decisions based on sensory and processing variables.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Identify **key determinants** of coffee quality based on sensory attributes like aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.
- Analyze the **relationship between processing methods**, origin regions, and total cup points.
- Explore the **impact of defects** on coffee quality scores.
- Perform **correlation analysis** to determine how individual variables contribute to final cup scores.
- Use **What-If analysis**, **DAX measures**, and **interactive visuals** to derive deep insights.

- **Source**: inspired by Coffee Quality Institute data
- **Data Size**: ~200 coffee samples
- **Key Fields**:
  - `Country of Origin`
  - `Variety`
  - `Processing Method`
  - `Aroma`, `Flavor`, `Acidity`, `Body`, `Balance`, `Clean Cup`, `Sweetness`, etc.
  - `Total Cup Points`
  - `Defects` and `Moisture Content`

## üß† Key Features & Techniques

| Feature                         | Implementation                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Cleaning**              | Handled nulls, unknowns, outliers, and inconsistent labels                      |
| **Calculated Columns/Measures**| Created custom DAX for KPIs, segmenting, and correlation scores                |
| **Advanced DAX**               | Used `SWITCH`, `CALCULATE`, `RANKX`, `ISINSCOPE`, `SELECTEDVALUE`              |
| **Drillthrough & Tooltip Pages**| Enabled for detailed exploration of origin and processing metrics              |
| **What-If Parameters**         | Simulate changes in sensory scores to observe effects on Total Cup Points       |
| **Highlighting Outliers**      | Subtle conditional formatting to flag nulls or extreme values (`#FFECB3` yellow)|

## üí° Key Insights

- **Overall, Flavor, and Aftertaste** show the highest positive correlation with `Total Cup Points`.
- **Washed Coffees** tend to score better on average compared to natural or semi-washed methods.
- Coffees with **primary defects > 1** almost always score below the 80-point specialty threshold.
- **Ethiopian, Tanzania and Taiwan** coffees are the top three rank higher across most sensory attributes.
